     <p><em>Hiii sweetie!!! Firstly let's not call it anniversery, I actually dont like it. It looks a bit cringe and kuchikoo couples type and we are definitely not those tiktok cringe couples.</em> </p>
     <p><em>And then the main reason of making this. I made this not only for this year but for all upcoming years which we'll celebrate for our togetherness.I'll keep adding pages to this as the years go by.Each page will show our one year and how we spent it.And that's how we'll have the record of what all stupidity we did.Maybe we can show it to our kids too😛😛</em></p>
     <p><em>And if you'll ever think of leaving me I'll make u read all this and make u stay😂😂</em></p>
      <p><em>I know it's dumb and too beginner level for u but I was able to learn only this much. Maybe in future I could make something better😁</em></p>
